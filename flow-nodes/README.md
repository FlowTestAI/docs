# Flow Nodes

A flow node is the smallest logical component and the basic building block of a workflow. They are designed to send an API request, manipulate input data or just execute some independent logic. In this section we will explain each of the current existing flow nodes. They are NOT set in stone, if you feel there should be a new node that is custom to your needs or generic enough for others to use, we would :heart: to integrate it in the platform. Feel free to start a [discussion](https://github.com/FlowTestAI/FlowTest/discussions) and we can chart out a plan.
