* **String** - Assigns a value of type string to the variable. &#x20;
* **Number** - Assigns a value of type number to the variable.&#x20;
* **Boolean** - Assigns a value of type boolean to the variable. &#x20;
* **Now** - Assigns a value of type now() epoch timestamp to the variable. The value of now() is calculated on the fly during graph run. &#x20;
* **Expression** - You can compute an expression on the fly to assign value to this variable. For instance , create a variable `startTime` that is assigned `now() - 3minutes`
